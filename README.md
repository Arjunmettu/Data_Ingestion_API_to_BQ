# Data_Ingestion_API_to_BQ

API to BigQuery to GitHub Batch Data Ingestion

This project is a batch data ingestion pipeline that retrieves data from an API, loads it into Google Cloud BigQuery, and then exports it to GitHub. The data can then be accessed and analyzed using various analytics tools.

Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

Python 3.x
Google Cloud SDK
Google Cloud BigQuery
GitHub account
Installation

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/api-to-bigquery-to-github.git
Install the required Python packages:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

Configure the project by setting the necessary environment variables:
arduino
Copy code
export API_KEY=your-api-key
export GCP_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
export GCP_DATASET_ID=your-dataset-id
export GITHUB_REPO=your-repo-name
Run the batch data ingestion pipeline:
css
Copy code
python main.py
This will retrieve data from the API, load it into BigQuery, and export it to GitHub.
Configuration

To configure the project, you will need to set the following environment variables:

API_KEY: Your API key for accessing the API.
GCP_PROJECT_ID: Your Google Cloud project ID.
GCP_DATASET_ID: Your BigQuery dataset ID.
GITHUB_REPO: The name of your GitHub repository.
API Integration

This project retrieves data from the API using the requests library in Python. You will need to provide your API key in the Authorization header of the API request.

Data Transformation

The data is transformed and prepared for ingestion into BigQuery using Pandas, a Python data manipulation library. This includes data cleaning, data normalization, and data validation.

BigQuery Integration

The data is ingested into BigQuery using the google-cloud-bigquery library in Python. The table schema is created dynamically based on the data, and the data is loaded using the load_table_from_dataframe method.

GitHub Integration

The data is exported to GitHub using the github library in Python. The data is exported to a CSV file, which is then uploaded to a specified GitHub repository.

Automation

This project can be automated using a cron job or a cloud scheduler. You can schedule the pipeline to run at regular intervals to retrieve the latest data from the API and update the BigQuery table and GitHub repository.
